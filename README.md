# real_update

This version of the projecct is an improved version of [tv_announcement_system](https://github.com/ktsuench/tv_announcement_system.git "TV Announcement System")

To get started, set up a SQL database and import the db setup files as tables. The db setup files have template values filled in so that the system is running once set up and shows it's functionality. Feel free to play around with the system and fork it at anytime. This repo will be updated eventually to contain new functionality, improved settings, and an improved interface.

Another note is that this system uses the [CodeIgniter PHP framework](http://codeigniter.com/ "CodeIgniter").
